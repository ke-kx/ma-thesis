\chapter{Implementation}
details about implementation and pitfalls that had to be overcome

\section{Bytecode Analysis}
maybe rename section?

soot as analysis framework -> what is soot
why bytecode over sourcecode
\ldots

\section{Improvements}
using a database + flexible python benchmarking / analysis
-> proper overview of resulting system: java analysis -> db -> python

explaining all the work i did
    first reading their code, coming across a couple of discrepancies between code and paper, later check if everthing still works (evaluation)
    refactoring everything + saving stuff to database
    building python infrastructure for analysis

\section{Dead Ends}
why some solutions where discarded (eg pure database / could be revisited if it turns out to be the best anyways - performance)
    clustering detector try
static functions evaluation!
something to fix the dotchaining problems

\section{Benchmark}

building benchmarking infrastructure
downloading + automatically analyzing android apps (in evaluation section?)

some changes that had to be made to the analysis framework for android analysis
