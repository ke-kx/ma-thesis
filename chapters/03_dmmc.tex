\chapter{Detecting Missing Method Calls}

%--- quick intro again why it is interesting to detect them

%--- overview of this chapter

\section{Majority Rule - existing work}
%--- start with intuition (restaurant example)


%--- formalized -> read the papers again for inspiration

%--- what is a type usage

%--- what are exactly equal and almost equal

%--- strangeness score calculation

%--- caveats

\section{Extensions / my work}
theoretical explanation of the different approaches
    load type usages in different ways
        per class type usages / ignore context
    look for different things (wrong method call, superfluous method)

    naive bayesian learner as baseline?
    something as of now unknown from anomaly detection
    clustering approach (hypersphere)
    working with the inheritance hierarchy!
