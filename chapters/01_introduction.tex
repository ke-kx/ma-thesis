First: some stuff about real life situation where missing method call can be a problem
-> find different bug report then the one the Majority Rule papers uses, but something like that
  
\section{Motivation}<++>
Motivating the research aka which problem are we trying to solve
general description of the problem

General idea why we want to use Recommender Systems / Learning!
-> much better than fixed preprogrammed rules, can adapt to changing system, be specific for own not open library, etc

Mention the ideas of \cite{bruch2012ide}, chapter 2 as an inspiration / the way to the idea
first find likely recommendations, for writing, then realize, if something is super likely given a particular situation, but it is not there, it seems like a good indicator of an error

\section{Contribution}<++>
reevaluation of the type usage characterization introduced by XXX
type usage is\ldots

Further evaluation of the concept with comparison test using different similarity measures, \ldots

FINALLY: Summary of the other chapters of this thesis
