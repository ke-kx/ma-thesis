I would like to thank the preliminary readers of this thesis XXX, YYY and the participants of the thesis writers workshop for their effort and valuable feedback.
Without you this thesis would contain a heap of errors and the style would be bleak.
I would also like to extend my gratitude to Torben, who helped me out with a useful software subscription, and of course my supervisors, Benjamin and Lars, who helped me keep on track and had useful questions and insights when they were necessary.
Finally, I am grateful to my parents for supporting my and to my roommate Caroline for keeping me sane.
