\chapter{Conclusion}
new method is amazing and way better in case xy but worse in zz
robustness has shown this and that
future research would be interesting in the direction of \ldots

\section{Contribution}
Datenset generiert, zumindest was über software sturktur lernen, bla !

\section{Future Research}
apply this anomaly detection method to other features (implements, overrides, pairs of methods, \ldots.)
Reihenfolge von Methoden - hat gut funktioniert und wäre potentiell nützlich, aber kleines subset + lots of research already done
order of method calls? (probably should wait for empirical results - how long are typical method lists (state explosion, ...) / latice solution?)
efficient update (only update files touched by change + the scores for affected type usages) - maybe database view for scores will already do this automatically? 
higher precision by some means? (clustering, etc)
Performnance (shouldn't be a problem?)
