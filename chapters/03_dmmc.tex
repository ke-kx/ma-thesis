\chapter{Detecting Missing Method Calls}

 trennen: previous work + what i did -> move their stuff to related work?
	theoretical explanation of the different approaches
	Majority Rule - intuition (restaurant example) + formalized 

my work:
    naive bayesian learner as baseline?
    clustering approach (hypersphere)
    something as of now unknown from anomaly detection
    working with the inheritance hierarchy!
    per class type usages
    wrong method call, superfluous method

--- generally: (in this section or implementation? or somewhere totally else or not at all?)

3 main parts: Feature Extraction, Learning, Results -	for each tons of different options and combinations
FE:
    what are the features, restricted to method calls?, granularity? (including parameters?)
    method order?

Learning:
    Struktur finden und anomalien ermiteln	
    consider what the expected structure MEANS (eg bruch expects a kind of uniformity to object usages, which is probably mostly present in GUI etc Frameworks)
    maybe some method can also detect multiple missing calls, order, ...

Results:
	how is the "quality", under which circumstances?
	some kind of statement about the initial assumptions behind idea and
