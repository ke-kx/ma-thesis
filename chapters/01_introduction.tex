%1.  software systems want to use APIs to facilitate reuse, however using an api is not always trivial
Larger software systems often outsource a significant amount of work to existing libraries or software frameworks, which expose their functionality through an application programming interface (API).
Even if the designers of those APIs focus on making the interface as easy to use as possible, there is always a trade-off between usability and flexibility.
Especially more complex and powerful libraries cannot provide a trivial API, if they want to enable the user to use it in the way most appropriate for their specific use case.
Thus, in the case of large frameworks or very powerful libraries, often a lot of knowledge is required to invoke the API correctly.
There can be constraints or requirements which are not be clear from the outset, but which have to be heeded in order to avoid serious bugs or complications.
In the worst case, this knowledge might not even be explicitly documented.

%2. since it is often not trivial to use an api correctly, there will be ``wrong'' usages + examples?
The fact that APIs are not trivial and have might have complex requirements makes it inevitable, that there will be erroneous invocations of these APIs.
Such errors can relate to parameter choice, method order, or a number of other factors (e.g. some methods must be invoked in an extra thread, \ldots).
Examples which come to mind in Java are are call to \texttt{next()} without first checking with \texttt{hasNext()} if there is even another object in the iterator.
Or a class which overrides equals() without ensuring that hashCode() also is the same for two equal objects.

%3. correct usages of an api often share some underlying patterns + examples of them
Despite the fact that there might be manifold correct ways to use an API, often there are underlying patterns which the correct invocations have in common.
These patterns could take a lot of different forms and shapes, for example ``call method X before calling method Y'', ``if object Z is used as a parameter to method A it has to implement interface IA'', ``never call method M in the GUI thread'', etc.
For the Java examples mentioned above they could take the form of ``an object which implements \texttt{equals()} must also implement \texttt{hashCode()}'', ``if object A equals object B, their hashCode() must also be equal'' or ``a call to \texttt{next()} on an iterator should be preceded by a call to \texttt{hasNext()} to ensure that it actually contains another object''.

%4. if we can extract the patterns, hopefully the wrong usages will stand out and enable us to detect bugs
Patterns like these are also called API usage patterns \cite{robillard2013automated} and they can be used to detect potential defects.
If code in a software project deviates (too much) from the usual patterns when using an API, this hints at a bug or problem or is at least a code smell which should probably be corrected.
This makes it interesting to detect these unusual instances, also known as API misusages(?).

%5. we will focus on MMCs + top-level view of missing method calls + example
As already mentioned above, there are many subtle mistakes a developer can make when invoking an API.j:w
In this work we focus on one specific type of API usage problem, namely missing method calls, which can occur in the context of Object Oriented Programming (OOP).
In OOP software an object is normally used by invoking some of its methods.
Some types will then have underlying patterns such as: when methods A and B are invoked, then method C is called as well.
If there exists some usage (what is a usage?\ldots) where only methods A and B are called, then we can say that the call to C is missing.

As an example consider a Button class in a GUI system.
This button can either appear as a TextButton or as an ImageButton, where the first displays a word or short text regarding the button's functionality, while the second one only displays an image.
Then one could imagine that the function \texttt{setText()} is usually called together with \texttt{setFont()} whereas the function \texttt{setImage()} is called together with \texttt{setToolTipText()}.
If the programmer writes some new code where she creates a button and assigns it some text to display by calling \texttt{setText()} but forgets to also call \texttt{setFont()} this would be a missing method call and a bug in the code (imagine all buttons using a beautiful specialized font but this one button sticking with ComicSans!)

\section{Motivation}
% Motivating the research aka which problem are we trying to solve, general description of the problem

%7. missing method calls are a real problem which occurs in real software
In an informal review Monperrus et al. \cite{monperrus2013detecting} found but reports and problems related to missing method calls in many news groups, bug trackers and forums.
The issues caused range from runtime exception to problems in some limit cases, but generally reveal at least a code smell if not worse.

[Example]
Some stuff about real life situation where missing method call can be a problem
-> find different bug report then the one the Majority Rule papers uses, but something like that

%8 real developers struggle with problems related to mmcs even if the bugs do not make it to the production code
Consider for instance the following stack overflow post:
% TODO include example like Sandra from monperus paper about missing method call stalling development
Here a developer spent many hours of their valuable time on debugging a relatively simple problem related to just one method call which was missing.

%9. Monperrus et all also showed that the bugs sometimes DO get into the code, all in all we want to be able to detect them
However, developer not only spent time during development on bugs related to missing method calls, these kind of bugs also survive development and get checked into the code repository where they cause problems in the future.
In their extensive analysis of the Eclipse bug repository Monperrus et al. \cite{monperrus2013detecting} show that even in mature code bases there are many bugs related to missing method calls.
Together this makes it highly desirable to be able to automatically detect missing method calls in production code, not only to save expensive developer time, but also to make maintenance cheaper and easier.

% General idea why we want to use Recommender Systems / Learning!
%10. first idea for detection: static rules, but problem: very time/cost intensive
A simple and straightforward approach for this would be to build a set of hard-coded rules regarding method calls, such as for example:
\begin{itemize}
    \item ``always call \code{setControl()} after instantiating a \code{TextView}''
    \item ``in Method \code{onCreate()} of classes extending \code{AppCompatActivity} always call \code{setContentView()}''
    \item ``when calling \code{foo()} also call \code{bar()}''
\end{itemize}
Well crafted and thought-out rules like this could facilitate a very high precision in detecting missing method calls, however, creating and maintaining such a rules list would require a tremendous effort.
While such work might be justified for large and important libraries, the necessary effort would also grow with the size of the library until it becomes completely infeasible.

%11 solution: automatic detection, even if it has some drawbacks
To circumvent this problem, we would like to automatically detect locations in a code base where a method call is potentially missing without needing any further input.
Such an approach would adapt to a changing system without requiring additional work of a developer and could also be applied to proprietary code which is not open to the public.
While the discovered locations will probably not be 100\% accurate, they could then be examined by an expert who would determine the severity of the finding and issue a fix if necessary.

%12. additional advantages to automatic detection: continuous integration, adabtability, can be used on closed software, etc
-> express some more much better than fixed preprogrammed rules, can adapt to changing system, be specific for own not open library, etc

%13. how this work relates to recommender systems
the approach chosen in this work bases of recommender systems / learning
(Mention the ideas of \cite{bruch2012ide}, chapter 2 as an inspiration / the way to the idea - maybe)
first find likely recommendations, for writing, then realize, if something is super likely given a particular situation, but it is not there, it seems like a good indicator of an error

\section{Contribution}

In this thesis we present a thorough reevaluation of the type usage characterization first introduced by Monperrus et al.\cite{monperrus2010detecting} and further refined in a follow up publication \cite{monperrus2013detecting}
type usage: list of method calls invoked on variable of a given type which occur in the body of a specific method
Majority rules idea: if a type is used in one particular way many many times and differently only one (or few) times, this probably indicates a bug

Further evaluation of the concept with comparison test using different similarity measures, application to big data set of open source android applications, \ldots
mention some results!
