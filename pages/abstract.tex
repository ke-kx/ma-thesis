%TODO: Abstract

-> shorten!
nowadays software systems are very large and rely on frameworks and libraries
they provide an API to use them and this api should be as simple as possible
however because of big complexity and mumble mumble APIs cannot be trivial
This + the fact that documentation is sometimes flawed leads to errors in API usages

one such (frequently made) error are missing method calls
We investigate a new method for detecting missing method calls in java applications proposed by Monperrus et al
Main research question: how useful is this method in the context of Android applications (?)

to investigate this, we analyze a large body of open source android applications
besides manual evaluation of the main findings in X randomly selected Apps
also apply an automatic benchmark which relies on artificially degrading the code at hand (maybe not mention this?)
the results are kind of mixed, but point in the direction of this method being marginally useful
+ some concrete numbers!
