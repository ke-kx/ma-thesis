\chapter{Implementation}
details about implementation and pitfalls that had to be overcome
    soot as analysis framework -> what is soot
    why bytecode over sourcecode
    \ldots
why some solutions where discarded (eg pure database / could be revisited if it turns out to be the best anyways - performance)
    static functions evaluation!
    something to fix the dotchaining problems
    \ldots

explaining all the work i did
    first reading their code, coming across a couple of discrepancies between code and paper, later check if everthing still works (evaluation)
    refactoring everything + saving stuff to database
    building python infrastructure for analysis
    building benchmarking infrastructure
    downloading + automatically analyzing android apps (in evaluation section?)
    
details on the different detectors I implemented

--- generally: (in this section or implementation? or somewhere totally else or not at all?)

3 main parts: Feature Extraction, Learning, Results -	for each tons of different options and combinations
FE:
    what are the features, restricted to method calls?, granularity? (including parameters?)
    method order?

Learning:
    Struktur finden und anomalien ermiteln	
    consider what the expected structure MEANS (eg bruch expects a kind of uniformity to object usages, which is probably mostly present in GUI etc Frameworks)
    maybe some method can also detect multiple missing calls, order, ...

Results:
	how is the "quality", under which circumstances?
	some kind of statement about the initial assumptions behind idea and
