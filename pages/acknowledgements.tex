I would like to thank the preliminary readers of this thesis Albert, Bene, Pete, Siggy and Fabi for their efforts and valuable feedback.
Without you this thesis would contain a heap of errors and the style would be bleak.
I would also like to extend my gratitude to my supervisors, Benjamin and Lars, who helped me stay on track and had useful questions and insights when they were necessary.
Finally, I am grateful to my parents for supporting me and to my roommate Caroline for keeping me sane.
