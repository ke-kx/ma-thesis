\chapter{Implementation}
	details about implementation and pitfalls that had to be overcome
	why some solutions where discarded (eg pure database / could be revisited if it turns out to be the best anyways - performance)

explaining all the work i did
    first reading their code, coming across a couple of discrepancies between code and paper, later check if everthing still works (evaluation)
    refactoring everything + saving stuff to database
    building python infrastructure for analysis
    
details on the different detectors I implemented
